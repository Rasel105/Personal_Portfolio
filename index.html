        <h3>Mission</h3>
        <p>
          I will keep the beginners mind by playing and experimenting without
          the fear of failure. There will always be things I have to learn and I
          will make mistakes, which develop me

        <h3>Vission</h3>
        <p>
          I graduated as a Computer Engineer in 2019. I was fulfilled but there
          was something missing. I always wanted to learn how to code but still
          did not know how to. I had intermediate knowledge from studying and
          taking online courses

          />
        </div>
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>
          Software developers work with machine languages to design and
          construct programs computers can run to complete complex computations.
          As a software developer I can use career goals to shape my career.

            As a Software developers I can decide on a direction and establish
            where to take my career by setting goals. These goals can be
            different areas of my career or I can progress toward a specific end
            goal. Accomplishing goals can help my career that aligns with what I
            want. I can set expectations and use goals as individual steps to
            help my achieve those expectations.

            If you want to grow as a developer, I can't over-emphasize the
            benefits of joining a developer community. There are many
            advantages, from peer-programming to sharing knowledge, mentorship,
            sharing support, sharing tools, code reviews, answering questions,
            and much more.
